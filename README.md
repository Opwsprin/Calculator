# Calculator
Final project from TOP on the Foundations course

Hm. Ugly code. I did not figure out a way to store the two different numbers and the operator, other than splitting the screen to three and reading the contents separately. It works, but it is ugly and difficult to read.

Did most of the extra credit points, but for the keyboard support. May return to it in the future.

My calculator looks better than the most voted solution on TOP! :D

One bug that is bothering me: if I type large enough numbers, hte digits extend beyond the calculator. Should be fixable with some clever css wrapping, but haven't done it yet.

I wonder if making the buttons into objects would be better / more efficient / more readable. Will look into it in the future (that is probably a lie - I don't think I will return to this to refactor the whole code).
